            We do not think 'bout these haters, we just count this bread
            
            
            [Chorus]
            I count money (Nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
            I count money (Nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
            I count money (Nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
            I swerve in a Humvee (Nuh-nuh-nuh)
            I just went crazy, I did it
            I just went crazy, I did it, huh
            I just went crazy, I did it, huh
            I just went crazy, I did it, uh
            I made a song for the Minions, uh
            How much they paid me? A million, uh
            I shop and then donate to charity (Woo, I donate it to charity)
            Take a cranky, I be smacking the ceiling, uh
            I call my Minion my children (Children)
            I call my children my Minions (Ha (Huh?), hey Mel, la bastichi
            La papaya, du la potato (Yeah, la potato, oh, yeah))
            We taking over the world (The world)
            We make a whole lot of millions</p>
